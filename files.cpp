files are the collection of data store in a disk.
jo data transmit horha hota in the form of binary this is called stream of data.
Input stream and output stream hoti. Input stream se data ko read krte file ke or output stream se data ko write krte in file.
    
The file is a patent of data which is stored in the disk. Anything written inside the file is called a patent, for example: “#include” is a patent. The text file is the combination of multiple types of characters, for example, semicolon “;” is a character.

The computer read these characters in the file with the help of the ASCII code. Every character is mapped on some decimal number. For example, ASCII code for the character “A” is “65” which is a decimal number. These decimal numbers are converted into a binary number to make them readable for the computer because the computer can only understand the language of “0” and “1”.

The reason that computers can only understand binary numbers is that a computer is made up of switches and switches only perform two operations “true” or “false”.


File Input and Output in C++
The file can be of any type whether it is a file of a C++ program, file of a game, or any other type of file. There are two main operations which can be performed on files
